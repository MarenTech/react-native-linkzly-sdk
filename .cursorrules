# Cursor Rules for Linkzly React Native SDK

## Custom Commands

### `/prepare-release`
Triggers the release preparation script. When the user types `/prepare-release`, you should:
1. Check that they want to proceed with the release
2. Execute the `./release.sh` script
3. Guide them through any interactive prompts (release notes, tag confirmation, etc.)

The release script (`./release.sh`) handles:
- Staging and committing changes
- Updating version in package.json
- Creating git tag
- Pushing to remote
- Creating GitHub release (if gh CLI available)

To execute: Run `./release.sh` in the terminal.
